# Can I Sue My Employer for Sexual Harassment or Assault at Work?

At ADZ Law, LLP, we believe every Californian deserves to work free from unwanted advances, sexual discrimination, or intimidation. We understand that pursuing a civil lawsuit against an employer for sexual harassment or assault can be daunting, so we aim to provide clarity on:

- your legal options
- the civil litigation process
- how to prepare for a consultation with an experienced attorney

### Who Can I Sue for Harassment or Assault that Happened at Work?

You can generally bring claims against the individual who committed the harassment or assault and, in many cases, against your employer as well. An individual defendant can be sued for assault, battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, while an employer can be sued when it knew or should have known about the misconduct and failed to take reasonable steps to stop it.

### How Suing Your Employer Differs from Suing the Individual Who Harmed You

Suing the individual focuses on that person’s conduct and intent, while suing the employer focuses on the employer’s knowledge, policies, and response to the situation. Employers can be held liable for the acts of supervisors and coworkers if the employer failed to prevent harassment or correct it.

From a practical standpoint, the important thing is that employers have deeper pockets and insurance that make recovery more likely, while individual defendants usually have limited assets.

### Preserving Evidence

Preserve anything that documents the incidents and their effects. This means:

- written communications such as texts and emails
- short written notes describing what happened
- medical or counseling records
- any internal reports you filed

If any personnel actions followed the incidents, keep performance reviews or disciplinary records.

An experienced attorney will typically interview witnesses, subpoena employer records and personnel files, obtain medical and counseling records (with your consent), and work with experts when needed to document psychological or physical harm.

Early preservation of evidence is crucial, because memories fade and records can be lost or altered.

### What Remedies Can I Seek in a Civil Lawsuit?

A civil lawsuit can seek compensatory damages for medical and mental‑health care, therapy, lost wages, and pain and suffering. In some cases, punitive damages may be available to punish particularly egregious conduct. When the employer’s policies or practices contributed to the harm, a court can also order them to change their workplace practices, require training, or impose monitoring on the company. Many plaintiffs pursue claims on a contingency-fee basis, meaning the attorney is paid a percentage of any recovery, but fee arrangements and potential costs should be discussed at the outset.

### Procedural Steps and Timelines

The civil process typically begins with a confidential consultation and an investigation. In many employment‑related claims, there are administrative steps to complete before filing a lawsuit, such as filing a charge with a state agency or the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. After any required administrative process, a lawsuit is filed, followed by discovery (an exchange of documents and depositions between the parties), settlement negotiations or mediation, and, if necessary, trial. Statutes of limitations and other timing rules vary by claim and by whether the defendant is a private employer or a public entity, so prompt legal review is important to preserve your rights.

### Challenges to Anticipate

Common defenses the defendant will raise include:

- denial of the allegations
- disputes about memory or credibility
- arguments that the employer took reasonable steps to address complaints

Employers often have experienced defense counsel and resources to litigate aggressively, which can make litigation lengthy and emotionally taxing. If you name an individual defendant, consider collectability: even a successful judgment may be difficult to enforce if the individual lacks assets or insurance, which is often less an issue when an institution is sued. Your attorney will weigh these practical realities against what your goals are: accountability, compensation, workplace change, or some combination.

### How Should I Decide Whether to Sue and What Strategy Is Best?

Deciding whether to sue involves balancing:

- accountability
- emotional cost
- the likelihood of recovery

If your primary goal is policy change or to stop ongoing misconduct, injunctive relief and administrative complaints may be effective. If you seek compensation for harm, a civil suit against the employer may be more appropriate.

Early legal advice helps you preserve evidence, understand deadlines, and choose a strategy (litigation, mediation, or settlement) that aligns with your priorities.

### Preparing for a First Meeting with an Attorney

Prepare a concise written timeline of incidents with dates, names of people involved (including witnesses), copies of any communications or reports, and any medical or counseling records you have. Be ready to describe what you want to achieve and any confidentiality concerns you may have. Most civil‑litigation firms offer confidential consultations and will explain fee arrangements, including contingency fees and potential costs.
