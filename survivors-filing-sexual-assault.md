# What Survivors Need to Know about Filing a Sexual Assault Lawsuit

Sexual assault survivors don't just have the criminal justice system to turn to. They can also pursue civil lawsuits against their abusers and any institutions that enabled or concealed the abuse. Civil lawsuits can provide survivors with a sense of justice and financial compensation for their injuries, as well as prevent future abuse by holding abusers and the institutions that shelter them accountable.

Survivors deserve to know their rights and options when it comes to filing a sexual assault lawsuit. This includes who can be sued, what kinds of claims can be brought, the statute of limitations, potential damages, and the legal process involved.

### Who Can Be Sued and What Kinds of Claims Can Be Brought?

Survivors can file lawsuits against the individual perpetrator of the sexual assault as well as any institutions that were negligent in preventing the abuse. This can include schools, workplaces, religious organizations, and other entities that had a duty to protect the survivor.

### What Kinds of Outcomes Can Survivors Get from Filing a Civil Lawsuit?

Civil lawsuits can result in positive outcomes for victims of sexual assault, including financial compensation for medical expenses, therapy costs, lost wages, and pain and suffering. Additionally, successful lawsuits can lead to institutional changes that improve safety and prevent future abuse.

While no outcome is guaranteed, pursuing a civil lawsuit can empower survivors and provide a sense of closure. The financial compensation can also help survivors cover the costs associated with their recovery. While monetary compensation cannot undo the harm caused by sexual assault, it can provide survivors with resources to help them in their healing journey.

The legal process can be lengthy and emotionally challenging, but survivors should know that they have the right to seek justice and support through the civil legal system.

### What Are the Statutes of Limitations on Filing a Sexual Assault Lawsuit?

Under the current statutory framework, childhood sexual‑abuse claims are governed by rules that allow a survivor to file civil claims either until age 40 or within five years of discovering the psychological injury, whichever is later.

Recent changes have allowed survivors of adult sexual assault to file civil claims without as much time restriction. For abuse occurring on or after January 1, 2024, there is no statute of limitations for bringing a civil action for sexual abuse. Additionally, for adult survivors, there is a temporary revival window that permits some plaintiffs to bring claims that would otherwise be prevented from being filed due to the statute of limitations. This new window runs from January 1, 2026 through December 31, 2027 and applies to certain claims arising from sexual assault of a person 18 or older.

While these changes provide more opportunities for survivors to seek justice, it is important to consult with a qualified attorney to understand how the statutes of limitations may apply to individual cases.

### What Evidence Should Survivors Gather?

To build a strong case, survivors should gather as much evidence as possible, including medical records, witness statements, photographs, and any communication related to the assault. This evidence can help establish the facts of the case and support the survivor's claims. While gathering evidence can be difficult and emotionally taxing, it is an important step in seeking justice.

### What Practical Challenges Might Survivors Face When Filing a Sexual Assault Lawsuit?

Filing a sexual assault lawsuit can be a complex and challenging process. Survivors may face emotional hurdles, financial costs, and the potential for public scrutiny. It is important for survivors to have a strong support system in place, including legal counsel, mental health professionals, and trusted friends or family members.
